"""Prove the deployed contract is the contract in this repository.

    python scripts/verify_deployment.py 0xYourAddress

A submission is judged on the DEPLOYED source. The reviewer reads it back off
chain, diffs it against the repository, and runs the linter on those bytes -- so
a repository that is correct proves nothing on its own if the address points at
an earlier draft. Two GenLayer submissions have been rejected for exactly that,
with the fix already sitting in the repo, unreachable.

This script does the same three things the reviewer does:

    1. reads the contract source out of the deploy transaction on chain
    2. diffs it against contracts/recant.py, byte for byte
    3. runs `genvm-lint lint` on the bytes that came off the chain

It exits non-zero if any of them fails, so it can gate a submission.
