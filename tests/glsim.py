"""
glsim — a small GenVM stand-in, good enough to execute the real contract files.

This is not a test. It is the harness the tests run on. It exists so the
DETERMINISTIC HALF of each contract can be executed for real: storage writes,
re-derivation, the plausibility gate, the validation branches. The pure
consensus helpers are already covered by tests/test_logic.py; everything below
the block is what this reaches.

It deliberately models the parts of GenVM that cause bugs:

  * a non-deterministic block runs TWICE, once as the leader and once as a
    validator, with independent mock responses, so a contract that assumes both
    runs see identical data is caught here rather than on a real network
  * the validator's verdict decides whether the transaction proceeds
  * a leader that raises produces a non-Return result, exactly as the runtime does
  * storage is snapshotted before a write and rolled back if the method raises,
    so a half-written record shows up as a failure
